# LaberynthSF
This is one more attempt at making the laberynth game. We will see what happens

## Compile & run
The code is only dependent on SFML Library.  
To install in derived Debian linux distros:  
```  
apt get install libsfml-dev  
g++ map.cpp TextureManager.cpp Laberynth.cpp -o Laberynth `pkg-config --cflags --libs sfml-all`
./Laberynth
```  

# shipcrush
